This app is a simple quiz by guessing the name of a country with it's flag. You can select the continent and all the flags of it's countries are shown one by one.
You can run this code in your local machine. 
I have dockerized the app and available at docker hub `https://hub.docker.com/r/vysnu96/flag-quiz-without-db`
